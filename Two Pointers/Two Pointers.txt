Absolutely yes 🚀 — you can directly jump to **Two Pointers**, Kaustubh.
In fact, after HashMap and Prefix Sum, **Two Pointers** is the most *must-know* DSA pattern for arrays & strings.

I’ll now give you a **complete structured guide** (same format you liked) — but this time, **we’ll go even deeper**: not just one generic template, but **all the common variations of two-pointer patterns** that appear in interviews.

# 📚 Master Topic 1: Arrays & Strings

## 📂 Sub-pattern 1: Two Pointers

---

### 🧠 Generic Template

```python
def two_pointers(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        # process
        if arr[left] + arr[right] == target:
            return [left, right]
        elif arr[left] + arr[right] < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
```

---

### ❓ Why to Use?

* Efficient for problems that require **pair/triplet searching**.
* Removes the need for nested loops (`O(n^2)` → `O(n)`).
* Commonly works when the array is **sorted** or can be **sorted**.

---

### 📍 When to Use?

* Array/string is **sorted**.
* Problem asks for **pair, triplet, closest sum, remove duplicates, reverse in-place, palindrome check**.
* Whenever you need to **shrink/expand from both ends**.

---

### 🧩 Keywords in Questions

* “sorted array”
* “pair/triplet/quadruplet”
* “closest sum”
* “remove duplicates in-place”
* “reverse / palindrome”
* “container / max water”

### 📦 Types of Two Pointer Problems (with Template for Each)

---

#### **1. Opposite Ends (Classic)**

Used in **pair sum / container / palindrome** type problems.

```python
def two_pointers_opposite(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        curr_sum = arr[left] + arr[right]
        if curr_sum == target:
            return [left, right]
        elif curr_sum < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
```

🔑 Use when array is sorted and you’re searching for pair/triplet/quadruplet.

---

#### **2. Same Direction (Fast–Slow Pointer)**

Used in **remove duplicates, move zeros, linked list cycle** problems.

```python
def two_pointers_same_direction(arr):
    slow = 0
    for fast in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[fast] != 0:   # condition to filter
            arr[slow] = arr[fast]
            slow += 1
    return arr
```

🔑 Use when you need to filter elements in-place.

---

#### **3. Expand/Contract Window**

Used in **valid palindrome, valid subsequence** problems.

```python
def palindrome_check(s):
    left, right = 0, len(s) - 1
    while left < right:
        if s[left] != s[right]:
            return False
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    return True
```

🔑 Use when checking mirror-like property (strings, arrays).

---

#### **4. Sorting + Two Pointers**

Used in **3Sum, 4Sum**.

```python
def three_sum(nums):
    nums.sort()
    res = []
    for i in range(len(nums) - 2):
        if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i-1]: continue
        left, right = i+1, len(nums)-1
        while left < right:
            total = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right]
            if total == 0:
                res.append([nums[i], nums[left], nums[right]])
                left += 1; right -= 1
                while left < right and nums[left] == nums[left-1]: left += 1
                while left < right and nums[right] == nums[right+1]: right -= 1
            elif total < 0:
                left += 1
            else:
                right -= 1
    return res
```

🔑 Use when extending pairs into **triplets/quadruplets**.

---

### ⏱️ Complexity

* Time: `O(n)` for pair search, `O(n^2)` for 3Sum, `O(n^3)` for 4Sum.
* Space: `O(1)` (except output list).

### ⏳ Time to Spend per Problem

* **Easy** → 15–20 mins
* **Medium** → 30–45 mins
* **Hard** → 60–90 mins

If stuck:

* 10 mins no progress → reread question.
* 20 mins stuck → small hint.
* 30 mins stuck → full solution, retry next day.

✅ So Kaustubh, this **Two Pointers Guide** covers:

* All patterns (opposite ends, same direction, expand/contract, k-sum).
* Templates for each.
* Problems bucketed into basic → filtering → triplets → advanced.

👉 Do you want me to now **expand Sliding Window in the same detailed structure** (all variations: fixed-size, variable-size, longest/shortest substring, etc.) — or would you like to **solve these two-pointer problems first** and then move to sliding window?
